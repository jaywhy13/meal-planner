I want you to build a meal planner system. You'll need to build a frontend in React and a backend in Django. 

Here are the functionality that we need:
- A spreadsheet for the month that allows me to enter different foods. Each day should allow us to enter different foods.
- The foods we enter should be saved, so that we can auto-complete those foods for other days. 
- We should also have suggestions in the app. In general, we want to create a meal plan that is healthy and balanced.
- I want to be able to generate a meal plan that's populated with different ideas. 
- We should facilitate creation, editing and deletion of multiple meal plans.
- Each meal plan should have a name.
